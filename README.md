### Built with

- I tride to build this challenge using HTML5 and CSS3 only (since I get use to build it with Bootstrap)
- how to make div at the center with margen as it Specified at figma file

```css
.main-dev{
    width: 384px;
    height: 522px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 5px  5px black;
    background-color: #ffff;
    border: 1px solid black;
    margin : 218.5px 528px;
}
```
- use figma for the first time to build this challenge 



### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

- I wanna to be more Confident with CSS3 (manipulating the margen and pading of element)
- Customise the responsive of the website Four different screen size 


### Useful resources
